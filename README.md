# Matters Forum

## Motivation

This is the [matters.town](https://matters.town/) coding challenge. It consists of two parts:

- [Code Challenge](./CodeChallenge.md)
- [Written Challenge](./WrittenChallenge.md)

The guide has asked to make something interesting, so I replicated some workflows that I would personally like to see if I were to make apps or improvements on top of the matters app.

Not to being critical on the current state of UI of matters, but I prefer something more lightweight and contentful that respond almost instantly to my perception, such as the [hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) interface. I interact with it through an RSS reader interface, and if I would like to interact with the post, the individual item page isn't too clunky either. I want to recreate something lightweight but not lack of capturing the unique decentralized & uncensored content on matters.
