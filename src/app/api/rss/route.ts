  <![CDATA[ <p>LEGO has teamed up with a lot of other brands over the years, but this one in particular seems aimed directly at me. A new <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/dungeons-dragons-red-dragon-s-tale-21348">Dungeons &amp; Dragons themed LEGO set</a> will be launching on April 1st, 2024. I’m a <a href="/2024/03/06/a-nasa-rpg-adventure">sucker for tabletop games</a> and also for LEGO in general, so I’m very tempted by this.</p> <p>I first learned of it via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/19/24105862/lego-dungeons-and-dragons-pictures-price-release-date">a great Verge article</a>, which has more details including a photo of the included one-shot campaign. Also, if you order before April 8th, you’ll get a <a href="https://anderegg.s3.amazonaws.com/lego-dnd-mimic-chest.jpg">bonus mimic chest</a>? That is some powerful FOMO-based marketing.</p> <p>Looking at this, I was curious about when all the LEGO brand partnerships started. As far as I can tell, it seems to have started in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_timeline#1990s:~:text=Lego%20produces%20the%20first%20licensed%20theme%20with%20Lucasfilm">1999 with a Star Wars set</a> tied to the release of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Episode_I_%E2%80%93_The_Phantom_Menace">The Phantom Menace</a>. More recently, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/23990575/lego-fortnite-release-date-how-to-play">LEGO Fortnite has been a big hit</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Lego_themes">list of LEGO set themes</a> is increasingly filled with IP from other brands. It’s wild to see how much LEGO has embraced the “metaverse” idea.</p> ]]>

Each of the players takes the role of someone who took part in the Hubble program and still has memories of it. The introduction has players being transported to a rogue planet where magic is possible thanks to the power of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-point_energy">zero-point energy</a>.

  <content type="html" xml:base="https://anderegg.ca/2024/02/24/bluesky-frustrations-part-2">
  <![CDATA[ <p>On Thursday the <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/02-22-2024-open-social-web">Bluesky team announced</a> that users now can host their own content on the network. This sent me on a tangent looking into the AT Protocol (atproto) again. It turns out that a good amount has changed <a href="https://anderegg.ca/2023/05/09/bluesky-frustrations">since I last dug into things</a>.</p> <p>The announcement linked to a <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/self-host-federation">developer focused post</a> which stresses that this is a work is in-progress and not really ready for prime time. This isn’t a knock against the announcement — the team is working in the open. However, after reading this I had several thoughts and questions.</p> <p>It might be helpful to mention the “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03239">Bluesky and the AT Protocol: Usable Decentralized Social Media</a>” white paper. It was published earlier this month and gives the fullest overview I’ve seen of atproto’s architecture. It helped me understand some of the technical decisions and trade-offs.</p> <p>With that, the meat of the announcement is that users can now host their own <a href="https://atproto.com/guides/data-repos">Personal Data Server (PDS)</a>. This server allows for user authentication and data handling through atproto. There’s <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/pds/tree/main">a sample server provided by Bluesky</a> which can be hosted on fairly modest hardware. <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p> <p>The Bluesky team is up-front that the process of <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/pds/blob/main/ACCOUNT_MIGRATION.md">migrating to your own PDS could break things</a>. They advise users against migrating their primary accounts. In the same document they also point out that the process is currently one-way only. This will likely change with time, but for now there’s no way to hand things back to Bluesky. It’s also a rather hands-on process: you need to join a Discord and request that your PDS be added to the network. Once you’re accepted, you’ll be kept up to date on Discord about changes and updates. Overall, things are kind of sketchy at the moment.</p> <p>When I first started digging into the migration process, I was curious about how media files would be moved. Users have been able to export their content from Bluesky for a while now, but the file you get back is not exactly easy to work with. There is some <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/repo-export">documentation about the export format</a> with code snippets to help you deal with it, but it’s a bit of a faff. It’s interesting to note that media files are not included in this export, and that you need to navigate the <a href="https://ipld.io/docs/codecs/known/dag-cbor/">IPLD DAG-CBOR</a> objects manually to get that content yourself.</p> <p>It’s also interesting that the export documentation contains a <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/repo-export#privacy-notice">privacy notice</a>. Because of atproto’s architecture, almost everything is public. By design, you can easily use the export process to download any user’s data.</p> <p>Looking at the <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/pds/blob/main/ACCOUNT_MIGRATION.md">account migration documentation</a> again, there’s <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluesky-social/pds/main/assets/account-migration.png">a diagram</a> in the above link that shows the process of migrating. This seems to indicate that the server would get this content for you. Reading further down the page, it looks like this is something you need to do manually. There’s some sample code provided, but the document stresses that it shouldn’t be run as-is.</p> <p>On the whole, this is an interesting first step. But it also shows how early Bluesky is in the process of federation. PDS migration seems shaky at best, and will need a lot of work to get it to a point where most technical people would want to give it a shot.</p> <p>While I was looking into the migration, I also spent some time digging into some previous frustrations with atproto. The first being the <a href="https://github.com/did-method-plc/did-method-plc?tab=readme-ov-file">DID PLC (short for “placeholder”) method</a>. One of my larger complaints about atproto is that it’s rather complicated. DID PLC is a a great example of that, and I recommend checking the white paper linked above for a good overview.</p> <p>It was <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto-website/blob/e4890f8129cfd4a0e6c42b49503ffbbe70e588db/content/specs/did-plc.md">previously noted in the documentation</a> that they wanted to replace this method “within the next few years”. <a href="https://atproto.com/specs/did#">This has been updated</a> to say it will be supported indefinitely. The main reason the team wants to replace this method is that it’s centralized. If you want to resolve a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">did:plc</code> id, you need to ask the server at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://plc.directory/</code> about it. It’s mentioned that Bluesky wants to make this decentralized eventually. This system is sort of like the DNS of the Bluesky platform, so I think this will take a while.</p> <p>Another nitpick I had was around indexing and relays. As part of atproto, Bluesky operates an index of all actions (posts, replies, likes, etc.). To create this index, they crawl all PDSs and then act on any new content found in them. While the Bluesky team have made progress on allowing people to host their own content, there’s very little detail on how this system will be decentralized. Even once it can be, this is “firehose” level stuff. It will take a lot of compute/disk/network resources to spin up a new index.</p> <p>This corner of the system is <a href="https://atproto.com/guides/overview#achieving-scale">rather light on detail</a>. There’s a bit of a description in the white paper, but I haven’t found technical details about how this system works. It also seemingly changed since I last wrote. There’s <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/5-5-2023-federation-architecture">a Bluesky blog post</a> from around that time which describes a “big world with small world fallbacks” system, but mentions of that seem to have been removed from the documentation. A <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto-website/blob/e4890f8129cfd4a0e6c42b49503ffbbe70e588db/public/img/small-big-world.jpg">previous version</a> of the “Crawling Indexer” diagram has been replaced with a <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto-website/blob/main/public/img/small-big-world.jpg">new one</a> which removes the “Small-world” interconnects. I assume that means it isn’t part of the plan anymore?</p> <p>After digging into this again, I’m still frustrated by the design trade-offs the Bluesky team is choosing. The system is currently centralized. I don’t doubt that they want fix this eventually, but I feel like they’re often given credit for having solved the problem already. Unless I’m missing something, decentralizing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">did:plc</code> and indexing systems will be extremely difficult.</p> <p>It’s also still unclear how any of this will be monetized. They <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/7-05-2023-namecheap">partnered with Namecheap last year</a> to sell domains you can use as your username. I guess that’s something, but I doubt it’s going to make much money relative to infrastructure (let alone personnel) costs. My guess is that most people who’d use a domain as part of their username already have the domain they want to use. It seems like they have a good amount of runway, but I’d bet that the service will be less fun to use when <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/7-05-2023-business-plan">investors start looking for a return</a>.</p> <p>I think people will be surprised by how little privacy there is on the service. Because of the indexing flow, all data currently must be public. As noted above, you can export any user’s data. You can also <a href="https://firesky.tv/">easily attach to the firehose of all new posts</a> and also just <a href="https://worthdoingbadly.com/bsky/">literally download the whole thing</a>. Again, this is all by design and not necessarily bad. I just think it might be surprising to many.</p> <p>I’m personally a fan of ActivityPub. The standard has several issues, but the key benefit is that it’s quite straightforward. Even as atproto work moves forward, there are still a lot of unanswered questions. It feels like there’s a good deal of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect">second-system effect</a> going on. I’d still prefer my “team” win, but I’m curious to watch Bluesky/atproto develop.</p> <hr /> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"> <p>Based on the <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/pds/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#preparation-for-self-hosting-pds">provided specs</a>, hosting the project on a Digital Ocean VPS would start at <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/droplets#basic-droplets">$18 USD/month</a>. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> </ol> </div> ]]>

  <content type="html" xml:base="https://anderegg.ca/2024/02/18/some-thoughts-on-jekyll">
  <![CDATA[ <p><a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> is a static site generator built in <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>. It’s been powering this site <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120927072029/http://anderegg.ca/">since 2012</a> but I’m worried that might not be true for much longer. I’m a bit torn on how to feel about this.</p> <p>First, a bit on static site generators (SSGs). Serving only static content is <em>fast</em>. With an SSG, you’re effectively “pre-compiling” all server-side elements of a site at build time. Once you send the “compiled” version of the site to your server, the files just need to be served. This is the easiest possible thing for a web server to do, so it scales extremely well. A <a href="https://anderegg.ca/2024/02/02/why-isnt-the-html-element-100-supported">recent post</a> was the number 1 post on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> for over 6 hours. This generated a lot of traffic, but my site never slowed down.</p> <p>There are many providers who specialize in hosting static content. A popular choice is <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a>. I’ve really enjoyed working with their system in the past, and have recommended it to others. Heck, you can also just use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteHosting.html">Amazon S3 to host static content</a>.</p> <p>This site is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>, which uses Jekyll by default. I enjoy using GitHub in general, and their Pages product is free. It’s also powered by Microsoft’s server infrastructure, which is no slouch. Getting set up to host using GitHub Pages is as easy as setting up a repo and pushing content built for Jekyll. Using a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site">custom domain</a> on your site is straightforward and also free. <a href="https://github.blog/2008-12-18-github-pages/">Jekyll was also written with GitHub Pages in mind</a>. It seems like a perfect match.</p> <p>In August of 2019, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/news/2019/08/20/jekyll-4-0-0-released/">Jekyll 4.0</a> was released. The same day, a <a href="https://github.com/github/pages-gem/issues/651">GitHub issue was created</a> requesting that GitHub Pages be updated to support the new version. That issue is still open, and as of <a href="https://github.com/github/pages-gem/issues/651#issuecomment-1208290235">August 2022</a> an engineering manager at GitHub has indicated that this update isn’t going to happen anytime soon. Also, previously the Jekyll to GitHub Pages flow was a special case that happened when committing to GitHub. Now it all uses <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions</a>, putting Jekyll on about the same footing as any other SSG.</p> <p>As of this writing, <a href="https://pages.github.com/versions/">Jekyll 3.9.5 is the version supported by GitHub Pages</a>. GitHub <a href="https://github.com/github/pages-gem/releases">continues to maintain</a> the libraries used to support Pages, but I’m not convinced that there’s much appetite for larger changes. If anything starts breaking because Jekyll 3.x is too old, my guess is that we’re going to be told that GitHub Actions is a great alternative.</p> <p>Because it’s easier, I’m currently running the latest version of Jekyll 4.x locally and still using the default GitHub Pages updating flow. This hasn’t bitten me yet, but it doesn’t seem ideal. Also, Jekyll is also the only Ruby project I use frequently. I should probably set up the same level of library/environment control as I do with my Python projects, but I haven’t so far. I’ve become quite proficient at fixing Jekyll when <a href="https://docs.brew.sh/FAQ#why-does-brew-upgrade-formula-or-brew-install-formula-also-upgrade-a-bunch-of-other-stuff">Homebrew updates break it</a>, but again: not great.</p> <p>So, am I going to switch right away? No. But I’ve started looking at alternatives. The biggest two are <a href="https://www.11ty.dev">11ty</a> and <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>. 11ty has the advantage of being written in JavaScript, so the tooling is familiar to me and I feel I could manage it well. Hugo is written in <a href="https://go.dev">Go</a>, however it seems quite self-contained. If I’m not using the Jekyll-specific parts of GitHub Pages, I could effectively ignore how Hugo is built and just think of it as a black-box.</p> <p>Whatever I do, I’m sure there will be tradeoffs. The publishing flow today with Jekyll and GitHub pages is going to be very hard to beat, but seeing <a href="https://rknight.me/blog/eleventy-post-graph-plugin/">some of the cool things</a> people are doing with newer tools like 11ty has me feeling some serious FOMO.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>I saw a <a href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@Ronflaix/111862153259345050">Mastodon post</a> that made me laugh this morning. It seemed sort of crazy that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">html</code> element <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-html_elements_html">wouldn’t have 100% support</a> on CanIUse.com. Heck, I’ve been using it since 1994 and it worked just fine back then! This led me down a bit of a rabbit hole.</p> <p>A bit of background, first. <a href="https://caniuse.com">Can I Use…</a> is a site that helps web developers track the adoption rate of web technologies. It estimates browser usage, measures feature compatibility, and spits out a number that tries to reflect how available a feature is. It’s a site I’ve been using almost since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100430032738/http://caniuse.com/">it launched in 2010</a> and I’ve always found it really useful.</p> <p>So why is it currently saying the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">html</code> element only has 97.34% support? That’s less than the current support percentage for the <a href="https://caniuse.com/audio"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">audio</code> element</a>! It also looks like the same is true for the <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-html_elements_a"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a</code></a> and <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-html_elements_p"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">p</code></a> elements with exactly the same 97.34% support number.</p> <p>One thing I learned when looking into this is that a lot of the data on the site actually comes from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN</a> <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. MDN is another resource I use and trust, so this seems reasonable to me. It also often has stats about feature uptake, so it makes sense for CanIUse.com to piggyback on that.</p> <p>Looking at the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html">MDN page for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">html</code> element</a>, it has a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html#browser_compatibility">browser compatibility section</a>. In that are two rows with a lot of red Xs. The first is for the optional <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">manifest</code> attribute on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">html</code> element. This is deprecated and was never standardized. The second is the related “<a href="https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-secure-contexts/">secure context required</a>”, which is an <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/types/#x2-3-editor-s-draft">Editor’s Draft</a> — that is, not something currently on the standardization track. I don’t know how this was previously related to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">html</code> element, but that use was also <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-html_elements_html_manifest_secure_context_required">never standardized and is deprecated</a>.</p> <p>So, there are two features listed here that almost all browsers <em>correctly</em> do not support. But still, it doesn’t look like this is the reason for the missing 2.66%. There are some browsers that are listed as “Support Unknown”. Adding up all the current usage for these browsers comes to 1.27%. There’s also an entry for Android Browser versions 2.1–4.3 which is listed as not supporting the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">html</code> element — which I find highly dubious — but it’s listed as having a usage share of 0%. I suppose there might be some rounding errors here that would bump the 1.27% to 2.66%? But I still find this very unclear. Also, I feel very confident that those older browsers supported the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">html</code> element!</p> <p>So yeah, I don’t have a great answer for this. If you do, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gavinanderegg">please let me know</a>! I’ve always taken the numbers from CanIUse.com with a few grains of salt, but I’ll be adding a few more going forward. I still think it’s a great resource.</p> <hr /> <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="https://cliff.social/@rezonant">rezonant</a> on Mastodon poked me to let me know that he posted a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39236148">comment on Hacker News</a> that has a possible explanation. The short version: if you switch to “% of all tracked” in the top right beside “usage”, and then add up the “support unknown” browser number, you get 99.98%. It’s a lot easier to see how rounding errors could make this the correct number. Still, I think the way older browsers are handled here is confusing. It doesn’t affect the overall number too much, but in the case of base level elements like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">html</code>, it seems odd.</p> <hr /> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"> <p>MDN used to stand for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDN_Web_Docs">Mozilla Developer Network</a>. Now it’s just MDN. I spent a few minutes looking on the MDN site to see if I could find any mention of the full name, but I guess they’re just all in on “MDN” now. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> </ol> </div> ]]>

  <content type="html" xml:base="https://anderegg.ca/2024/01/18/some-feelings-about-apple-vision-pro">
  <![CDATA[ <p>Preorders for <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/">Apple Vision Pro</a> start tomorrow. I’ve been thinking about this product at least since the <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/newsroom/2020/03/apple-unveils-new-ipad-pro-with-lidar-scanner-and-trackpad-support-in-ipados/">LiDAR Scanner appeared on the 2020 iPad Pro</a>. Strangely, as we’ve gotten closer to the launch, I’ve become less interested in it.</p> <p>Some ancient history to set the stage. In the early 90s, I got to try <a href="https://youtu.be/rVn3H93Ysag?si=qwk8e8lr96UliuYk&amp;t=420">Dactyl Nightmare</a>. I remember having to beg my parents for the try the thing, waiting in a long line, and only getting to play for a few minutes. It was amazing! I only vaguely remember the experience, but that low-poly world felt <em>real</em> in a way I could barely put into words.</p> <p>Fast forward to October 2013: I got to try the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculus_Rift#Development_Kit_1">Oculus Rift developer kit</a>. I was at a conference where a company was showing off a Paperboy-like prototype using the dev kit and a Microsoft Kinect. It was a bit janky, but still a very cool experience. For whatever reason, it didn’t feel as immersive as I remember that clunky-assed 90s game being. Maybe it had something to do with Dactyl Nightmare being over-hyped by my very young brain. It probably wasn’t helped by the demo being something thrown together quickly for the conference. Also, I was definitely older and more jaded. Whatever the reason, it didn’t seem as magical to me.</p> <p>More recently I’ve had occasion to try newer headsets from Oculus and Valve. These are great pieces of technology, and I’m glad people are continuing to work on them. But as cool as some of VR experiences were, I could never bring myself to buy a headset. I continue to feel pretty sure that if I did buy one, it would start gathering dust after a week or two. Gaming on a TV is easier and, frankly, more fun. If I could go back in time and tell this to my 90’s self, the little guy’s head would explode. All this to say: I think VR tech is <em>interesting</em>, but I’m not very excited by it.</p> <p>Back to the present: Apple’s launching a new piece of hardware tomorrow. I really like Apple hardware, and follow their announcements like other people follow sporting events. I <em>want</em> to be more excited about this than I am.</p> <p>One thing to note here: I’ve only really considered the “headset” space in the context of gaming. Apple has never been good at gaming. Recently they’ve been making motions toward getting serious about the gaming space, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pippin">they’ve got a lot of convincing to do</a>. This might just be a “me problem”, as I’m not sure the primary purpose of Vision Pro has ever been gaming related.</p> <p>But if not gaming, then what? “<a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/newsroom/2023/06/introducing-apple-vision-pro/">Spatial computing</a>” seems to be the idea Apple is pushing. One piece of this is having an “infinite canvas for apps”. That actually sounds pretty promising! However, I’m quite skeptical Vision Pro will have many apps I want to use out of the gate. When Apple launched the M1, it enabled iPhone and iPad apps to run in macOS. Sadly, for a variety of reasons, most developers chose to disable their apps from being run this way. A big reason for this was that most devs didn’t have M1 machines yet. They couldn’t confirm the mobile versions of their app would work well on macOS. I’d bet pretty heavily that the same thing will happen for visionOS.</p> <p>Another selling point of Vision Pro is immersive video. This is something I’ve definitely wanted at points, and I could imagine it being a huge boon for people who fly a lot. But that’s going to be hurt by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/17/24042179/netflix-apple-vision-pro-app">Netflix</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/18/24043540/youtube-spotify-apps-apple-vision-pro-visionos">YouTube</a> both choosing not to release apps for the platform yet.</p> <p>Of course, the position of the product at launch isn’t the whole story. The iPhone was world-changing device, but it didn’t really <em>do</em> much at launch. There was no App Store. You couldn’t record video. Heck, there wasn’t even copy and paste. It was still incredibly novel, but it only existed on one mobile carrier and it cost several times more than what most people thought a phone should. The same is true for the Apple Watch. In both cases, I got the third iteration and continued to use them going forward.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/5/23750003/apple-vision-pro-hands-on-the-best-headset-demo-ever">People who’ve had a chance to try Vision Pro</a> seem to think there’s <em>something</em> there. Maybe not enough to justify the current price tag, but it seems like there’s <em>something</em>. Just like when Apple launched their watch, there seems to be a bit of throwing things at the wall to see what sticks. Because of this, the meme is that Vision Pro is a “public dev kit”. But as someone who helps people build software products, advice I always give to clients is: get things into the hands of users as soon as possible. It’s the very best way to see if you’re on the right track. Apple has a great track record for building extremely polished hardware, but the software always takes large turns after version 1.0. I think people forget this.</p> <p>The one thing I am really excited about regarding Vision Pro is the story. Apple’s doing something different here. Maybe it’s not for me. Maybe it’s just not for me <em>yet</em>. Maybe I’ll try one (once they’re available in the far-flung land of Canada) and I’ll buy one on the spot. Whatever the case, I’m pretty sure they’re going to sell out of initial stock on day one. What comes next will be a lot of hot takes, and I’ll be here for all of them. If this thing takes off, that will be interesting! If Apple has a dud, that will also be very interesting! Let’s see what people say once they start shipping out. I’m excited for all temperatures of take.</p> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>I volunteer with a <a href="https://halifaxpartnership.com/how-we-help/support-your-career/">great local program</a>. Through it, I help connect newcomers to the local tech scene. One of the standard pieces of advice I give is: get a library card.</p> <p>Sometimes there’s a puzzled look. Who cares about libraries these days? At least for me, libraries have only got more interesting in the past decade. My plan is to try and get you to look into your library’s services by bragging a bit about what my library offers.</p> <h4 id="online-learning">Online learning</h4> <p>This is usually the reason I bring up getting a library card. I often get asked if I know of good places to start learning some technology. Our library system has <a href="https://www.halifaxpubliclibraries.ca/blogs/post/how-to-learn-with-linkedin-learning/">partnered with LinkedIn Learning</a> (formerly Linda.com). Not everyone learns best from reading books or documentation, and YouTube can be hit or miss. It’s news to just about everyone I speak with that our library offers this content for free.</p> <h4 id="printing">Printing</h4> <p>When I started freelancing, I got a cheap multi-function inkjet printer. I still use it for scanning, but it turns out that I print things too infrequently. Ink is expensive, and I found it was often dried out when I wanted to use it. These days I print everything at the library. Everyone with a card gets 50 pages a month for free, and it’s $0.10 a page after that.</p> <h4 id="3d-printing">3D printing</h4> <p>I’ve only used this service twice, but it’s been extremely helpful for prototyping. With my library card, I have access to <a href="https://www.halifaxpubliclibraries.ca/blogs/post/how-to-get-started-with-3d-printing/">3D printing services at the main branch</a>, a <a href="https://libraries.dal.ca/services/photocopying-printing/3d-printing.html">engineering campus at a local university</a>, and also a few others. The cost is based on time, weight, or the amount of filament used. If you’re looking to give 3D printing a shot, this might be a better way to go than an expensive device you’ll use a handful of times.</p> <h4 id="libby">Libby</h4> <p>This kind of falls in the category of “normal library stuff”, but <a href="https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby">Libby</a> is an astonishingly well designed app. Just enter your library card details and start reading books, listening to audiobooks, browsing magazines, or checking out manga/graphic novels. You may need to be added to a waitlist, but you can sign up for notifications when things are available. Libby works with just about all libraries in North America. If I wasn’t already paying stupid money for Apple One, this is how I’d read <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/edge/">Edge</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/retrogamer/">Retro Gamer</a>.</p> <h4 id="streaming-video">Streaming video</h4> <p>Aside from physical video media that you can borrow from most libraries, many provide access to streaming services. A common one is <a href="https://www.kanopy.com/en">Kanopy</a>, but some services like <a href="https://www.hoopladigital.com">Hoopla</a> also offer streaming video.</p> <h4 id="newspapers">Newspapers</h4> <p>This might not matter to some, but I still like having access to traditional news media. Our library offers <a href="https://www.pressreader.com">Pressreader</a>, giving card holders the ability to read digital hard-copies of hundreds of papers from around the world.</p> <h4 id="space">Space</h4> <p>Libraries offer a lot of services to the community, but the space itself can be useful. Obviously they can be places to work and research, but they also often hold events. My library holds regular <a href="https://halifax.bibliocommons.com/events/654299ee5c850f480054913e">small business sessions</a> and helps with <a href="https://www.halifaxpubliclibraries.ca/business-careers/collections-resources/business-grants-and-financing/">startup financing</a>. Heck, a nearby library also offers a <a href="https://halifax.bibliocommons.com/events/657765dce7f74a2a00468f42">D&amp;D drop-in</a> that I just learned about while writing this. Also, if you’re researching something, librarians kinda do this for a living. There’s a good chance they know about other resources you might not. At least at my library, they’re great folks!</p> <h4 id="hopefully-its-not-just-me">Hopefully it’s not just me</h4> <p>I want to say that I feel privileged to live just a few blocks from an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halifax_Central_Library">award winning library</a>. That said, I grew up in a small town with a library that also offers most of these services. Also, you may have access to more than just one library. In Halifax, my library card gives me access to many services from the three university libraries in walking distance.</p> <p>I personally think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halifax,_Nova_Scotia">Halifax</a> is special, but it’s a pretty small city. Check out what your local library has to offer. You might be surprised!</p> ]]>

I first learned about Noodler’s inks from <a href="http://jetpens.com/">JetPens</a> when I ordered a bottle of <a href="https://noodlersink.com/product/19183-la-reine-mauve/">La Reine Mauve</a> last year.

This is fine, as the inks are still very pretty and quite useful — I just felt a bit foolish for not knowing this.</p> <p>When trying to understand what went wrong, I came across a great resource on the JetPens site which breaks down the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/blog/Noodler-s-Fountain-Pen-Inks-A-Comprehensive-Guide/pt/902">properties of all Noodler’s inks</a>. I then used this to reference the list of inks available at my amazing local bookstore, <a href="https://bookmanager.com/1163574/?q=h">Bookmark</a>. It turned out that they had a number of waterproof inks <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, which is great to know for later.</p> <p>However, as I was browsing the Bookmark site I came across something else that caught my eye. A <a href="https://www.twsbi.com/products/twsbi-eco-glow-green-fountain-pen">TWSBI ECO Glow Green Fountain Pen</a>. I’m a sucker for glow-in-the-dark stuff, so I made a trip down to pick this up. More inks are a great excuse for more pens to put them in, right?</p> <p>The upshot here: I’m glad to know more about Noodler’s lineup of inks, and I’m excited to have a new glowy pen to put some of them in!</p> <hr /> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"> <p>“Bulletproof” in Noodler’s nomenclature. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> </ol> </div> ]]>

  <![CDATA[ <p>When it comes to writing posts on this site, the phrase “I don’t like writing, I like having written” resonates strongly. I enjoy getting more posts on the site, but I find it strangely difficult. I want to post more in 2024, so I’d like to get past this.</p> <p>Most of my job is writing. I write emails and documents daily, mostly about challenging or technical subjects. I also keep a daily handwritten journal. I find this sort of writing easy and enjoyable.</p> <p>When it comes to posting things on the public web, I often second-guess myself. “Who cares?”, I wonder. I’m sure someone’s written something about this before. Sometimes I stop short because I realize there’s a lot I don’t know about a subject. I end up in a rabbit-hole of research and give up because it seems like too much work.</p> <p>But again, this doesn’t seem to happen with other types of writing. Why is that?</p> <p>For journaling, the answer is pretty easy. I’m just writing to myself. I enjoy the physical act of writing — of using pens and inks and paper. I’m writing for myself, to work out ideas and remember things for later. Likely, no one else is going to read the journal. It’s just for me, so I don’t feel self-conscious about it.</p> <p>For work writing, I’m not so sure I know the answer. Maybe it’s because I’ve been doing this long enough that it’s a “mode” I can get myself into. Also, I’m often already considered a trusted advisor by my clients when I write about tricky subjects. I don’t need to convince them that I know what I’m saying. If a client pushes back on something, I find it natural to engage and understand their point of view. After that it seems easier share my perspective and come to some middle ground. This is easier when it’s a handful of professional contacts rather than the entire web.</p> <p>But writing on the web can be extremely rewarding! In 2023, I got three posts to the front page of Hacker News <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. People were reading my stuff, and I had a very fun time watching analytics numbers go up! Yeah, sure, some people didn’t like what I had to say — but most of them were making rational points. So far, the anxiety of people disagreeing with me is always worse than the reality of it. I really hope it stays that way.</p> <p>Also, I’ve mostly been using my site for “think pieces”. I’ve gotten so used to posting small, fun things in private chat groups or social media sites. I want to change that, but I think it’s going to be a tricky habit to break. A site I’d like to crib from is <a href="https://kottke.org/">kottke.org</a>. The way Jason includes small title-free posts in his main feed seems liberating. Similarly, I love how The Verge added short posts into their <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/13/23349876/the-verge-website-redesign-new-newsfeed-blogs-logo">late-2022 redesign</a>. When working toward the new site structure, Nilay Patel said: “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/23352835/verge-website-redesign-embeds-podcast-vergecast">Why am I finding it easier to publish on someone else’s platform instead of my own?</a>” <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. This has been stuck in my mind ever since.</p> <p>The upshot of all this is: I need to get over myself. I need to stop worrying and just post more things. I plan to make some changes to the site to hopefully make that easier, but this isn’t primarily a technology or tooling problem. I’m hoping change will come from practice and forming new habits. Hopefully this will lead to a better populated RSS feed in 2024 and beyond.</p> <hr /> <div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes"> <ol> <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"> <p>These were <a href="https://anderegg.ca/2023/12/15/the-threads-invasion">Thoughts on Threads and ActivityPub</a>, <a href="https://anderegg.ca/2023/05/09/bluesky-frustrations">Bluesky Frustrations</a>, and <a href="https://anderegg.ca/2023/02/01/a-novel-paypal-scam">A Novel PayPal Scam</a>. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p> </li> <li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote"> <p>He says this at around 8:50.

  <![CDATA[ When it comes to writing posts on this site, the phrase “I don’t like writing, I like having written” resonates strongly. I enjoy getting more posts on the site, but I find it strangely difficult. I want to post more in 2024, so I’d like to get past this. ]]>
